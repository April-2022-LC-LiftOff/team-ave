<h2> HELP BEYOND TARA </h2> 

<p> <i> When there are concerns involving safety of the anxious person or their loved ones involved in the situation, or anxiety is getting worse over an extended time instead of lessening, or for any other reason you think you need some professional help to handle a situation, there are crisis lines staffed by mental health professionals and specially trained volunteers. The creators of Tara app DO NOT endorse in most circumstances a first call to the local police, who are not trained in mental health response. (link to article about why this is especially dangerous for black, trans people?). </i></p>
